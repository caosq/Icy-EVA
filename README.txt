Note for OSX users
------------------
Because of system's restrictive security rules you may not be able to launch Icy properly after having downloaded it, in this case use the following steps to fix it:
- execute osx-appfix by right clicking on it (or Ctrl + click) and use 'Open'.
- double click on the Icy application icon and confirm application launch.
Now you should be able to use Icy normally.
