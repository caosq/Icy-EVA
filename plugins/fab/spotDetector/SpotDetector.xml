- Detects spots in noisy images 2D/3D.
- Depending on objective, spots can be nuclei, nucleus or cell
- Versatile input: sequence or batch of file.
- Detects spot in specific band/channel.
- Multi band labeling: automaticaly creates ROIs from one band and count in the same or an other band.
- Filters detection by size.
- Sort detection by ROIs
- Output data in XLS Excel files: number of detection by ROIs, and each detection location and size.
- Outputs withness image with ROIs and detection painted on it.
- Outputs binary detection image.
- Displays detections
- Displays tags
